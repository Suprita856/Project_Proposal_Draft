    "Today was a significant milestone in our learning journey as we transitioned from structured lessons to independent, synthesis-based work. The morning began with a comprehensive review of the curriculum, covering everything from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to various model architectures. This session helped me understand not just how each technique works, but when and why to apply it in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the review, the mentors presented five distinct problem statements, each with its own technical challenges and potential real-world impact. I spent the afternoon carefully analyzing each option, weighing the data requirements against the complexity and feasibility of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, I gained clarity on how to align a project with my current skill set while still embracing a healthy challenge. I ultimately selected a problem that excites me and feels well-suited for my capstone project.\n",
